# fargo's website

A personal website for the poet and performance artist Fargo Tbakhi.

For now, a static prototype, but eventually, a Gatsby powered static site.

I've been interested in doing as much as I can with the browser default styles for a while now - I've always like the minimalist approach to this sort of thing. I'm really proud of how this is shaping up.
